#MDN what?

MDN = Mozilla Developer Network, one of the best developer resources that not enough people seem to use.

#MDN Search from Sublime Text 2

This plugin will let you search MDN either by the word(s) selected or through the command palette and letting you input a search query.

Huge thanks to [Eric Martel for his SO Search plugin](https://github.com/ericmartel/Sublime-Text-2-Stackoverflow-Plugin) which served as a base for mine, so most of this code is his.

#Installation

Clone, and drop folder into your packages directory. Soon (but not yet) you should be able to access it through the package control plugin.

#Usage

Highlight text, right click & click "Search MDN". You can also go through the tools menu. Else, bring up the palette and type "MDN Search" to bring up the options.
